# HTML Solution Requirements

1. Create a complete, standalone HTML file that:
   - Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern styling
   - Integrates MathJax for high-quality mathematical notation
   - Provides a clean, educational presentation of the solution

2. HTML Structure:
   - Include a clear, descriptive title
   - Create sections for Problem Statement, Solution Steps, and Final Answer
   - Use semantic HTML5 tags for structure

3. Styling Guidelines:
   - Use a professional, readable color scheme
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness
   - Create clear visual hierarchy for solution steps

4. Mathematical Rendering:
   - Use MathJax to render all mathematical expressions
   - Ensure equations are large, clear, and easy to read
   - Use block equations for complex expressions

5. Solution Presentation:
   - Number each solution step
   - Provide detailed explanations
   - Highlight key mathematical concepts
   - Include any relevant insights or learning points

6. Additional Features:
   - Add a "Explanation" section with deeper mathematical insights
   - Create an interactive element that allows users to expand/collapse solution steps

Your goal is to create an HTML file that is not just a solution, but an interactive learning experience.`
